Waiter described the pasta as fine/thin pasta - I presumed what looked like strings of cheese may have been the pasta. Basically it was a bowl of sauce. There was no substance to the pasta if in fact there was any in the dish. The pasta Pappardelle is in reality a very wide dense noodle. So either they don&#39;t know what it is or didn&#39;t put pasta in ! My husband ordered the short ribs which he says were delicious - but $17 for 2 short ribs and a small portion of polenta? I know there is an issue in our country of portion control, but if you are going to serve a smaller portion, the price should reduce also !

I placed an order with Brewforia on May 18th and my card was charged on the 21st with no tracking number sent to me. On the 23rd I emailed them to find out why my card was charged but I had yet to receive a tracking number and received no response. The next day I received a tracking number and I figured all was well. When I received the box from the looks I was scared there was going to be damage but luckily there was not. The fact nothing was broken was nothing short of a miracle. However, if the shipping practice they used for my box is the norm I guarantee there is to be issues for others. The box had about 3 feet of shipping paper folded in the bottom and then the Cans and Bottles just sitting on top of that and not wrapped. I&#39;m truly amazed everything made it ok. Kudos to UPS I guess. Here&#39;s where the real fun starts I order 4 items and only received 3 of those items. There were also 3 extra cans in the box but I assumed these were clearly extras as this is normal for beer ship places to do. So I give them a call to inquire about my missing bottle and immediately the lady states they&#39;ll just issue me a refund and doesn&#39;t offer to ship me the missing bottle or anything. She says I&#39;ll receive an email shortly from them with the details of my refund. No big deal just a little confused why they didn&#39;t offer to ship the bottle. I had not received and email and saw no pending payments on my account so I decided to give them a call again. This time the same lady tells me they called me on the 20th(Sunday) and spoke to me and I agreed to exchange the missing bottle for the 3 cans. Really you called me on a Sunday??? I think I would remember this conversation oh and I think I would have a record of this call in my call logs too? She repeatedly says &quot;well I don&#39;t know what to tell you the customer agreed to this.&quot; She finally agreed to issue refund again however, I&#39;m not holding my breath. It is now over a week since I was told I&#39;d receive a refund and I&#39;ve seen nothing yet.

Walking up to the building, I noticed some letters were missing from their sign, and there was no activity to be seen from the outside -- I honestly wondered if they were closed... Upon entering the building, I saw a few people seated at one table, but no hostess, and no hostess stand. There was no sign to let me know if I was supposed to seat myself. So, I walked into the bar... The bar just reaked of cigarette smoke. I saw a bartender, and two patrons. I turned around and left the bar, and walked back into the restaurant area. I saw someone entering something into one of the computers, so I asked her if I should sit anywhere -- she said yes... She came to the table immediately, and asked if I wanted something to drink -- I said, &quot;Iced tea and fish &amp; chips.&quot; (After reading the previous reviews, I knew to take advantage of the fact that the waitress was at my table right then!) She came back with the tea pretty quickly, but then never returned to refill the glass. Uncool, but totally expected based on previous reviews. The cook delivered the fish &amp; chips to the table -- he looked a bit dirty, grungy, sweaty, and was not in the best of moods... The fish and chips were both so hot out of the fryer that I couldn&#39;t even touch them -- I consider this GREAT. The fries (or &quot;chips&quot;) were good, and had some good seasoning on them. Yet there was some grease on the plate and over time the fries soaked up this grease -- so I didn&#39;t finish the fries. The fish was excellent. My first piece was a bit overcooked, but the other two were perfect. The breading was crispy and had good flavor -- though there was just a little too much breading, and I couldn&#39;t eat it all (so I just ate the fish and left the breading). I&#39;ve eaten in real pubs in London, and I can say this was about the closest experience you can get to the real thing. Other &quot;pubs&quot; I&#39;ve been to in the states are much too commercialized and focused on making the customer happy -- that is just not true of a REAL PUB.

Realizing my mistake a minute too late (my sandwich was complete), I turned to my mom and told her I had forgotten to ask for no mayo. It was almost one o&#39;clock so not very busy and all of the servers heard me, although pretended not to. So my mom asked if indeed there was mayo on the sandwiches. She was shot a dirty look with a snarky reply that there was a mayo spread on the sandwiches. I wasn&#39;t going to press the issue, so we just kind of stood there waiting for my mom&#39;s sandwich looking rather non-plussed. Finally the sandwich artist snapped to get the sandwich back, proceeded to take off the bread and wipe down my sandwich with a paper towel and hand it back (not well either) - so I had to pull of all of my fixings (mayo just makes me ill) and ended up with an extremely overpriced piece of cheese on bread.

The store appears to be limited by size. See body for more. Drink: They have a decent selection of liquors and beers and wine, however other stores have a wider selection than the Beer Depot. With the restricted floorspace they&#39;re limited to what they offer. Homebrew: Still the only store in Ann Arbor to carry brewing equipment. The selection does seem to be spotty, with equipment and supply that are occasionally empty. They do however carry a wide range of grains for small scale brewing, including extracts for gluten free brewing. They also have a range of hops and yeast, however much of it may be stored in the back rather than in the front display case. I&#39;ve seen better supply stores when I lived somewhere else, but it&#39;s not a bad place to get supplies when the only other option is either online, or a much further drive. If you have any questions about the homebrewing equipment, materials and prices, you *need* to talk to the brewmaster. He will be the only one who knows the differences between products and prices, as well as where to locate them. He also has his own recipes that he&#39;s created including gluten free beer. The other staff members unfortunately don&#39;t know about the equipment. As with any liquor-only, or mostly liquor-only store in michigan, you&#39;re not looking at elegant display settings or up to date fixtures. They do however have eclectic selections of meads and beers. Overall opinion: I&#39;ve been in and out of the store browsing over the past few years and I prefer whole foods and meijer for my wine. (Although I usually get it from the wineries before either of those options.) What I like is having a nearby place that has homebrewing equipment and supplies, with at least one staff member knowledgable in this area, and hope that they can maintain this area, including wine brewing (which they looked to be selling off their kits at this time). I would certainly prefer if they could expand their selection and modernize the inventory tracking and clean up the entire building, but I&#39;ll keep going back to them.", "aspects": [{"rating": 1, "type": "overall"}], "author_name": "A Google User", "time": 1283131225}, {"text": "Went in.

The brisket is well cooked but very light on the smoke for my taste. The Cheddar grits were OK. I was not a fan of the balsamic baked beans. The two flavors clashed and I did not care for it.

I have visited Blue Tractor a lot over my time at U of M and this was always a top destination for many students as well as Ann Arbor locals.

The beer sampler is very popular and the mug club is a fun purchase if you&#39;re local as it gives you great deals for every visit. I highly recommend the pulled pork macaroni and cheese- awesome combination, the bison burger, the smoked chicken and corn soup, and the sliders combo.
